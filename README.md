The Asset Builder is a tool for choosing, recolorizing, and stacking images together of the same type.

Right now, only one asset pack is provided with the tool and it uses the assets provided by the Intersect MMO Engine. You can find the assets [here](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Assets).

## Usage

Head over to the releases page to get the program for yourself, or launch the script with python after installing the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python asset_builder.py
```

## Building Nuitka Executable

If you want to build an executable for yourself based on the python script, use:
```
python build.py
```
Note that after building, the "i" folder and the "packs" folder should be included next to the executable to properly use the tool.
